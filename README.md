# PyTorch Flowers Classifier

### Overview
===============
* PyTorch-based flowers classifier
* Note: This Project NOT Yet Completed!

### Dependencies
==================
* numpy
* PIL (pillow)
* PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/)

### Usage
===========
* first download and extract the dataset to the root folder from the link bellow:
* Training Dataset (https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd188/flower_data.zip)
* after that you can run the following commands:
* python setup.py (install all the Dependencies)
* python setup.py (this will install the Dependencies & start training)
* python train.py (this will start the training)
* python predict.py <path to the flower image> (this will predict the flower type of the input image)
